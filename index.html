    <h4 id="disclaimer">Before I get into the flesh of the book and my views, I need to say, this is a very silly book at times, and at others, a (somewhat) serious book. Others may say it's just 
        inconsistency, but I find it charming. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REVIEW, THIS IS FOR MINES AND OTHERS ENTERTAINMENT, and an assignment. </h4><br>
    <h2>SYNOPSES</h2><br>
    <hr>
    <div class="meat">
    <p>The book begins in 1945, when Franciscus, a genius child born of filth, (no, literally) finds his chromosomes are rapidly multiplying, this leads creatures of different dimensions
        to him, putting both him, and his whole universe in immense threat. He must traverse the nearly endless universes to find the one true god, who can tell him why these things
        are happening and what his purpose is. His journey is accompanied by friendly creatures of other dimensions, who grow as he does. They are hunted down by an evil diety throughout
        his journey, of whom they must either overpower, or escape, lest be put through a fate worse than death.

    <h2>OPINION</h2><br>

    <div class="meat">
    <p>As you could probaby tell already, I like this book, I find it a very worthwhile read. It's helped me through many boring afternoons and it hooked me from the beginning with
    the stupid, crude humor (which is present throughout mostly the whole book, excluded by very few parts) which I enjoy very much. It was made by George Miller, also known as 
    the controversial but widely loved, Filthy Frank, also a popular music artist known as Joji.
