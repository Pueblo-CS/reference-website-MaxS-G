    <h1> ABOUT GEORGE MILLER</h1><br>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="body">George miller started off in Okinawa, Japan in 1993,as a screaming little baby (to be later transformed into a man). In 2006, 
        he released his first Youtube video, a video of him breakdancing in his old school. Keep it up, baby!
        In the year 2008, Miller started a second channel ("DizastaMusic") for comedy sketches, but for fear of losing his channel (due to copyright claims and security), in 2014,
        he created a new channel, which we all know and love as TVFilthyFrank, where he adorned the title (as a king does his big, beautiful crown) "filthy Frank". Perchance.
        Sadly, as happens to every good thing, it came to an end, but in this end something new, monumental and beautiful arose from this great loss. That was Joji. 
        He began, humbly in the background, eventually rising higher and higher, his reach further and further, already kickstarted by his career as filthy frank. 
        His growth was exponential once he released the album "Ballads-1" in October 2018, followed by singles "Run", and "Gimme Love". After the Covid pandemic, Joji released
        the hit single, "Glimpse of us", which was a hit song from release, and peaked at number 8 in the hot top 100. His musical career goes on to this day, he has a lot in store
        for us.
